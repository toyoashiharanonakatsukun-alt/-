# 8-Layer Ontological Framework (8LOF)

Welcome to the official repository of the **8-Layer Ontological Framework (8LOF)**. 
This project provides a structural synthesis of metaphysics and physics, offering new insights into the nature of existence, life, and consciousness.

## 📄 Published Papers

### 1. [Paper 7] Structural Synthesis of Metaphysics and Physics
**Title:** 八層構造モデルによる形而上と形而下の接続構造の解明  
**English Title:** Structural Synthesis of Metaphysics and Physics: Elucidating the Interface through the 8-Layer Ontological Framework  

- **Abstract:** This paper elucidates the fundamental architecture of the 8LOF, bridging the gap between metaphysical logic and physical reality. It defines the eight-layer structure as a unified map for understanding existence.

### 2. [Paper 8] Ontological Considerations of Qualia based on 8LOF
**Title:** 八層構造モデルに基づくクオリアの存在論的考察：意識に先行する生命の駆動源  
**English Title:** Ontological Considerations of Qualia based on the 8-Layer Framework: The Life-Driving Force Preceding Consciousness  

- **Abstract:** This paper redefines Qualia (Layer 6) not as a byproduct of the brain, but as the primordial drive of life. By introducing the concept of "Primordial Qualia (C1)," it provides a structural reinterpretation of Benjamin Libet's experiments.

## 💎 Core Concept: The 8-Layer Model

The 8LOF categorizes existence into eight distinct layers to resolve the "Hard Problem of Consciousness" and other metaphysical dilemmas.

| Layer | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1** | Pure Form | Universal logic and mathematical necessity. |
| **Layer 3** | Belief / Intellect | Personal metaphysical reality and speculative intelligence. |
| **Layer 6** | Qualia | The subjective "drive" and "helmsman" of life. |
| **Layer 7** | Physical Reality | The material world as perceived by the subject. |

## 🚀 Future Outlook

The 8LOF aims to provide a new conceptual foundation for:
- **Neuroscience & Biology**: Redefining the role of the brain as an "integrator of qualia".
- **AI Ethics**: Evaluating the boundaries of artificial consciousness.
- **Philosophy of Life**: Restoring the dignity of "feeling" over mere "computing".
